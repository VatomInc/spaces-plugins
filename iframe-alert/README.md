# Iframe Alert :page_facing_up:

This plugin tests the ability to display iframes and custom UI within the app.

## Usage :clipboard:

- **Step 1:** Host the plugin on a [CORS enabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) server, or upload the entire `iframe-alert` directory into your own space
  - If you are hosting the plugin on a server, you need to copy the full URL to the `index.js` file
  - To host the plugin in your own space, you can go to File -> Storage and click the top-right "upload" button
  - Once it has been uploaded, click on the `index.js` file and select "Copy URL"
- **Step 2:** Add the plugin to your space by clicking "Plugins" and scrolling to the bottom to click the "Add from URL" button. Paste the URL to the plugin here.
- **Step 3:** Click the "MyAlert" in the bottom menu bar.
- **Done!** You will now see a popup that shows the contents of the HTML file.
